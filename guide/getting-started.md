# Getting started

## Before getting started...

We suggest you be familiar with `py-cord` and `python`. This is a `py-cord-components` guide so it couldn't contain a lot of python explanations.

## Install the library

First, we need to install the library:

```
pip install --upgrade py-cord-components
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you meet an error `No matching distribution found for py-cord-components` when installing, try updating the python version! (It must be upper than `3.6`)
{% endhint %}

## Send buttons

Assuming you have invited your bot to some server, let's code.
Create any python file and copy & paste the code below. (with replacing `your token` with your bot's token and `your prefix` with your bot's prefix)
